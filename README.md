Fork repository at [gstephbolivar github](https://github.com/gstephbolivar/engineering-team-generator) .

-npm install

-npm inquirer --save

-npm install jest

Happy Editing!

## Usage

This CLI application allows a manager to create a team html by following prompts and inputting their team information in the terminal. Then the information is generated into an output folder that holds the team html. Once opened in web browser, a user can see the managers team and some basic contact information for that team member.

## Contributing

A user can contribute by creating more styling to the html documents to allow the webpage to be more user friendly and professional. Also, a user can contribute by color coding the prompts to allow the user an easier view and input experience.
